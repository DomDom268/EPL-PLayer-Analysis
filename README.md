# 🏟️ EPL 2024/25 Player Performance Analysis

This project analyzes top player performances in the 2024/25 English Premier League (EPL) season using Python. The goal is to uncover trends in player stats based on position (Attackers, Midfielders, Defenders), and identify what metrics drive higher match ratings.

---

## 📊 Overview

- Cleaned and analyzed manually collected player data
- Explored statistical correlations by player position
- Visualized insights using correlation heatmaps
- Structured findings in a report-style Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Dataset

Collected manually from [WhoScored](https://www.whoscored.com//), includes:

- Average Match Rating
- Goals, Assists
- Minutes Played
- Average Passes
- Pass Success Rate
- Tackles, Clearances
- Position (Attacker, Midfielder, Defender)

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and report writing

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Attackers**: Goals are strongly correlated with match rating
- **Midfielders**: Goals are alos most important while Pass success and assists play a lesser role
- **Defenders**: Defensive metrics like tackles have an almost perfect correlation with average ratings
